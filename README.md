# linux-speaker-keep-awake

depends: ``pulseaudio``, ``pulseaudio-utils``

I will be tweaking the played inaudible sample with Audacity until this works enough to keep speakers awake, while remaining silent to you.

- v1 initial release

- v1.1 attempted to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.2 another attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.3 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.4 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.5 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.6 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.7 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.8 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.9 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v2.0 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample, but gentler, as we're close

- v2.1 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample, but gentler, as we're close

- v2.2 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample, but gentler, as we're close

- v2.3 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample, but even gentler, as we're EXTREMELY close

‚≠ê Woo! v2.3 perfected the sample, it kept the speaker awake all night long, so that bit's done!

- v3.0 fixes/pins the master volume to 64% permanently- **the speaker waking sample now can't be turned down accidentally leading to the speaker turning off**. Set all volumes for/in just individual applications instead, to turn up/down your levels for comfort.

üìå Note: Some "fancy" soundbars have features such as automatic volume leveling, dynamic range compression, EQ, etc, which can conflict with the way this script functions, and the frequencies it outputs, and may lead to audio ducking up and down in volume at random every few seconds. This is not a fault of the script, as regular headphones and speakers function perfectly with it. Try turning features like that off, on your speaker, or otherwise using speakers that bastardize the audio output from your computer less, and just pass through & play the sound exactly as it is.
