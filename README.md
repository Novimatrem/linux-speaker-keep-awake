# linux-speaker-keep-awake

depends: ``pulseaudio``, ``pulseaudio-utils``

I will be tweaking the played inaudible sample with Audacity until this works enough to keep speakers awake, while remaining silent to you.

- v1 initial release

- v1.1 attempted to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.2 another attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.3 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample
