# linux-speaker-keep-awake

depends: ``pulseaudio``, ``pulseaudio-utils``

I will be tweaking the played inaudible sample with Audacity until this works enough to keep speakers awake, while remaining silent to you.

- v1 initial release

- v1.1 attempted to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.2 another attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.3 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.4 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.5 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.6 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.7 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.8 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v1.9 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample

- v2.0 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample, but gentler, as we're close

- v2.1 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample, but gentler, as we're close

- v2.2 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample, but gentler, as we're close

- v2.3 a further attempt to increase effectiveness of sample, but even gentler, as we're EXTREMELY close

‚≠ê Woo! v2.3 perfected the sample, it kept the speaker awake all night long, so that bit's done!

- v3.0 fixes/pins the master volume to 64% permanently- **the speaker waking sample now can't be turned down accidentally leading to the speaker turning off**. Set all volumes for/in just individual applications instead, to turn up/down your levels for comfort.
